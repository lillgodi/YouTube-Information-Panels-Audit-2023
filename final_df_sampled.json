The word is the plural of the Latin illuminatus. According to adherents, the source of the \u201clight\u201d was viewed as being directly communicated from a higher source or due to a clarified and exalted condition of the human intelligence. To the former class belong the Alumbrados (Spanish: \u201cenlightened\u201d) of Spain. Spanish historian Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo first finds the name about 1492 (in the form aluminados, 1498) but traces them back to a gnostic origin and thinks their views were promoted in Spain through influences from Italy. One of their earliest leaders\u2014indeed, some scholars style her as a \u201cpre-Alumbrado\u201d\u2014was Mar\u00eda de Santo Domingo, who came to be known as La Beata de Piedrahita. She was a labourer\u2019s daughter, born in Aldeanueva, south of Salamanca, around 1485. She joined the Dominican order as a teenager and soon achieved renown as a prophet and mystic who could converse directly with Jesus Christ and the Virgin. Ferdinand of Aragon invited her to his court, and he became convinced of the sincerity of her visions. The Dominicans appealed to Pope Julius II for guidance, and a series of trials were convened under the auspices of the Inquisition.

The trail may be distorted by the winds, and sometimes it spreads outward to form a layer of cirrus cloud. On rare occasions, when the air is nearly saturated with water vapour, air circulation at the wing tips of an airplane may cause sufficient pressure and temperature reductions to cause cloud streamers to form. In the 1990s a popular conspiracy theory arose claiming that long-lasting contrails contained chemicals (\u201cchemtrails\u201d) that were sprayed by governments for purposes such as controlling the weather or dispersing drugs to influence the general population.

Spread by the advance of the British Empire, Freemasonry remains most popular in the British Isles and in other countries originally within the empire. Freemasonry evolved from the guilds of stonemasons and cathedral builders of the Middle Ages. With the decline of cathedral building, some lodges of operative (working) masons began to accept honorary members to bolster their declining membership. From a few of these lodges developed modern symbolic or speculative Freemasonry, which particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, adopted the rites and trappings of ancient religious orders and of chivalric brotherhoods.

The installation has been the focus of numerous conspiracies involving extraterrestrial life, though its only confirmed use is as a flight testing facility. For years there was speculation about the installation, especially amid growing reports of UFO sightings in the vicinity. The site became known as Area 51, which was its designation on maps of the Atomic Energy Commission.

The trail may be distorted by the winds, and sometimes it spreads outward to form a layer of cirrus cloud.

The Dominicans appealed to Pope Julius II for guidance, and a series of trials were convened under the auspices of the Inquisition.
